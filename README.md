# DAX for Power BI

## Overview

DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) is the backbone of calculations and data modeling in Power BI. This repository help users understand and apply **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)** in Power BI using real-world scenarios. 

## What's Inside?

The document provides a scenario-based reference across key DAX topics:

- **Core DAX Concepts**  
  Understand row context, filter context, and key differences between `SUM` vs. `SUMX`, and `RELATED()` for data modeling.

- **Time Intelligence Functions**  
  Use dynamic date calculations like `DATESMTD`, `DATESYTD`, and `DATEADD` to compute MTD, QTD, YTD values and compare historical data.

- **Period Comparisons**  
  Implement Month-over-Month (MoM) and Year-over-Year (YoY) comparisons to evaluate business performance trends.

- **Rolling Trends & Averages**  
  Write DAX for rolling 30-day averages, trailing sales, and average daily metrics using `DATESINPERIOD` and `AVERAGEX`.

- **Ranking & Top Filtering**  
  Rank months or categories using `RANKX` and apply conditional logic to show only top-performing periods.

- **Advanced Filtering with CALCULATE**  
  Use CALCULATE with multiple filters to isolate product, region, or time-specific insights (e.g., "YTD sales for Arizona Tea in Florida").

- **Function Comparison Tables**  
  Easily compare `DATEADD`, `SAMEPERIODLASTYEAR`, `PREVIOUSYEAR`, and `PARALLELPERIOD` with clear guidelines on when to use which.
